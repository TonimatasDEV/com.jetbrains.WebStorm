# com.jetbrains.WebStorm
I want to use latest WebStorm version, but I don't want to be a Flathub maintainer at the moment.

# How to install
```shell
flatpak remote-add --user --no-gpg-verify tonimatas https://flatpak.tonimatas.dev
flatpak install tonimatas com.jetbrains.WebStorm
```
I will archive that and remove the repository when the official repository have a new mantainer https://github.com/flathub/com.jetbrains.WebStorm
